CHANGELOG FOR hw1.10
	Griffin Stout

	Today I wrote some basic code to get ncurses working. You can now type
	in characters and it prints them on the screen. I'm having issues with
	loading the dictionary in because it's too big for the memory. Update:
	I did some research and found a think called a Bloom Filter. Will
	try to implement this

	04/20/2019

	Finished the implementation of bloom filter. Used murmur hash 2 by
	Austin Applyby for my hashing function but I think that's ok. Now I just
	need to make it check the word after you press space.

	I couldn't get the bloom filter to be accurate enough- it had a pretty
	high collision rate. So now I will go back to a smaller dictionary in
	order to load it into the program. I downloaded the linux one which is
	only ~45k words but should be fine for my purposes.

	update: it was able to load the dictionary. Now I just need to
	implement binary search on the array. This is one of the fastest search
	algorithms with O(logn). If it is still too long I will implement
	threads to let continuous typing occur.

	04/28/2019

	Today I finished writing my spellcheck code. See the readme on how to
	use it. It's not perfect but it works.
