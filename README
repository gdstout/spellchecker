To build my program, type 'make'. Then type ./spellcheck to run it.

The spellchecker will change the text color to red of any word it cannot find in
the dictionary. It runs a check on a word when you press the space bar. You must
fully delete a word to make it's incorrect status go away. The dictionary is not
case sensitive. This is not a grammar checker, but it will ignore basic
punctuation. 

Pressing 'ENTER' doesn't do anything and it won't check the word if you do.
